    <h2>Suggestions</h2>
    <p>I definitely recommend visiting the Azores, it is one of those places that is still very much untouched by mass tourism. Ideal for any kind of group or family.</p>
    <p>Below are some suggestions on what to do and eat there. I found it easier to group the days geographically to prevent needless driving as much as possible and make the most of your time there.</p>
    3 essential Apps:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a
          href="http://www.spotazores.com/"
          target="_blank"
        >SpotAzores</a>
        <ul>
          <li>Where you can access webcams in real time to check on the weather in different parts of the island. This allows us to decide where to go on a specific day or time;</li>
          <li>Check daily or several times per day;</li>
          <li>Can be accessed from a mobile phone;</li>
          <li>Unfortunately they are now using ads, but simply close them if they pop up.</li>
        </ul>

          target="_blank"
        >iOS</a>
        <ul>
          <li>When visiting Ponta da Ferraria to check on the tides and how warm the water would be.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>In the travel bag (other essentials you might need):
    <ul>
      <li>Swimwear (at least an older or cheaper set due to the possibility of some of the waters damaging them, such as in Terra Nostra Park, Dona Beija pool or Caldeira Velha pool)</li>
      <li>Dark coloured towels - for the reasons stated above</li>
      <li>Hiking boots / trainers</li>
      <li>Sun screen and hat</li>
      <li>Raincoat - In general be ready for it to be sunny and suddenly rain in the space of minutes (You can have a summer day and a few hours later it feels like you're in the middle of a storm!)</li>
      <li>Plastic shoes / slippers to walk on rocky places near the coast or the islet</li>
      <li>Room in your bag to bring home amazing food!</li>
      <li>Day suggestions (this list is not in a specific order, you should be flexible and take advantage of certain areas of the island with good weather according to the webcams - be particularly mindful of Fogo and Sete Cidades lagoons as they are frequently covered in fog and are very much worth it when the sky is clear!)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>DAY 1: Ponta Delgada</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Avenue (Walking along the avenue)</li>
      <li>Doors to the Sea (Portas do Mar) and quay (marina)</li>
      <li>Doors to the City (Portas da Cidade)</li>
      <li>Town Hall</li>

        >“A Tasca”</a>. The yam pie is very good. You will need to book in advance for lunch or dinner as it is constantly fully booked! Also pleasant for tea or coffee, but we have personally never been to outside of meal times.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>DAY 2: Sete Cidades</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Pico do Carvão Viewpoint</li>
      <li>Empadadas Lagoons</li>
      <li>Canário Lagoon</li>
      <li>Canário Forest</li>
      <li>Boca do Inferno Viewpoint</li>
      <li>King's Viewpoint (Miradouro Vista do Rei), overlooks the Sete Cidades Lagoons. One of them is blue and the other is green and you can clearly see the contrast here</li>
      <li>Next to the Viewpoint is an abandoned hotel, the Monte Palace Hotel (we are not sure if it is still undergoing construction, but the plan is to re-build it)</li>
      <li>Descent to Sete Cidades Lagoon by car, park somewhere and go around the blue lagoon (larger) by foot. If you have any snacks, by the lagoon is a very good place to picnic (please clean up afterwards)</li>
      <li>You can go to Mosteiros where there are sea water pools. In some places you can see how much contrast you get from the blue of the sea with the black of the rocks</li>
      <li>Ferrarias Spa, a Thermal Spa with several pools - one of them is outdoor right next to the sea - jacuzzi, massages, Turkish bath... You can swim in the sea, but you should check the App for the best times of day temperature-wise</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>DAY 3: Ribeira Grande &amp; Lagoa do Fogo (If the day is too foggy, you are better off doing this in a different day)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Serra da Barrosa Viewpoint, in the county of Vila Franca do Campo</li>
      <li>Go down to the Fire Lagoon (Lagoa do Fogo) 2 km up until the water itself on a trail that some consider challenging. It totals about 1 hour each way, but it is worth it</li>
      <li>Aftewards go down to Caldeira Velha by car for another 5 km (there are several viewpoints along the way)</li>
      <li>Caldeira Velha (3€ entrance fee for adults and 1€ for children or elderly) is a natural monument that is part of the Biosphere Reserve. It has a lot of exotic vegetation, a warm water pool and a warm water waterfall for thermal bathing (brown water is due to the iron content). It could have been like being in paradise, but it has too many people making a ruckus. The Caldeira is located in the Fire Volcano's crater, you will find fumeroles and a thermal water spring. There are ameneties that provide cold water showers and changing rooms to whoever wants to try the pools</li>

      <li>Ribeira Grande Castle's Viewpoint</li>
      <li>Sāo Vicente Pools - excelent for a swim in a gorgeous day</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>DAY 4: Furnas</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Drive to the Ferro Mountain (Pico do Ferro) with views above the Furnas Lagoon</li>
      <li>Drive around the southern coast to Furnas lagoon and park near the fumeroles - 0,50€ fee - and walk the trail that goes around the lagoon, takes on average 2 to 2 and a half hours.</li>
      <li>On the southern side of the lagoon in the middle of the trail surrounding the Nossa Senhora das Vitórias church, there is the José do Canto Garden Forest (entry fee is 2€)</li>
      <li>Around 12h30 it is worth going near the fumeroles to see people digging out the stew. The stew pans are buried around 6h00 for local restaurants or normal people, and they remain cooking until noon. Any person can cook their stew here as long as they bring their own pan with the ingredients from home. The cost for cooking is 3€. The hole for the pan has to be sealed with a wooden lid and covered with dirt, and must not be opened until the stew is ready</li>
      <li>If you want to try out the stew we recommend going to Tony's or Miroma restaurants</li>
      <li>Bolos Levedos - Gloria Moniz</li>
      <li>

          target="_blank"
        >Dona Beija Pool</a> – 6€ entry fee and water temperature at 38-40ºC. Additonal charges apply for towels, hot shower and locker. The water is loaded with essential minerals. There are shower rooms available with hot and cold water
      </li>
      <li>Terra Nostra Park (entry fee is 8€). By the entrance is a thermal water pool where you can swim in. The water is warm and an opaque orange tone (you cannot see the bottom) and is between 35-40ºC, which provides with an amazing relaxing feel. The water is loaded with essential minterals. There are two other smaller pools and the park has shower rooms available</li>
      <li>Go through the Salto do Cavalo Viewpoint, at 760 meters altitude where you can overlook a vast view over the Povoaçāo valley and its seven "Lombas". You can also see the sea on the horizon</li>
      <li>Go to Ribeira Quente beach, where you can find hydrothermal springs that add a warmer temperature to the sea water</li>
      <li>Return through the northern cost</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>DAY 5: Vila Franca do Campo</h4>

    <h4>Other suggestions</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Salto do Prego Trail (4.5 km). It 2 hours on average to do it, and you will find a gorgeous waterfall in the middle of the trail, where you can enjoy an extremely cold bath. It ends in the village of Sanguinho, which is under (re)construction and looks like a scene from a fairy tale</li>
      <li>The northern coast is typically prettier than the southern (travelling, viewpoints, etc.), so if it is sunny at a specific day we recommend prioritising it</li>
