    <p><i>O Planeta Limpo do Filipe Pinto</i> (Filipe Pinto's Clean Planet) was the second HTML5 Canvas project I worked on. It was made in partnership with a famous portuguese music artist Filipe Pinto and included the launch of a children's book as well as this game.</p>
    <p>It is built using pure Canvas APIs using no frameworks, using a lot of image assets provided by the Design team at Betweien and music and sound effects were provided by Filipe himself.</p>
    <p>There are four different game levels with varying difficulties, using different mechanics like drag and drop, keyboard events and procedural generation. These progress on these levels are tracked via cookies.</p>
    <p>This game was later ported as a mobile game to the App Store using node-webkit.</p>
