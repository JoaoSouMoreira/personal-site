# Personal Site

I have been talking about building a personal website for a while now and here it is! This is also a good exercise for me to use Front End tools that I had not previously used.
This website is a single page application built with Vue for rendering and Rollup for bundling and developing.

## Getting started

### Setup

In project's directory, execute:
```
yarn install
```


### Run

For development:
```
yarn start
```

To build the assets to be served:
```
yarn build
```
